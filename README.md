# AI-SDLC — Enterprise Software Development Lifecycle for Claude Code

> Turn Claude Code into a disciplined engineering team. Go from raw idea to production-ready, fully documented, thoroughly tested software — with process gates, architecture standards, and quality enforced at every step.

---

## The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful but undisciplined. Left to their own devices they:

- Jump straight to code before requirements are understood
- Build on shaky data models that break everything downstream
- Skip architecture decisions that matter at scale
- Write tests that test implementation details instead of requirements
- Ship code with no observability, no resilience patterns, no runbooks
- Produce undocumented decisions that haunt the team six months later

The result is fast-looking progress that collapses under real-world conditions.

---

## The Solution

**AI-SDLC** is a Claude Code plugin (`/sdlc:*`) that enforces a rigorous, opinionated software development lifecycle. It works the way a senior engineering team works — research before spec, spec before data model, data model before architecture, architecture before code — and it doesn't let you skip steps.

Every phase produces a canonical artifact. Every artifact is verified before the next phase starts. Every requirement traces forward to a test case. Every test case maps to an automation script. Every architectural decision is recorded as an ADR with a review trigger. Nothing falls through the cracks.

**One command to start anything:**
```bash
/sdlc:start "I want to build a payment processing integration"
```
The orchestrator reads your project state, classifies your intent, enforces gate conditions, and routes you to exactly the right next step.

---

## What You Get

### Phases that execute, not phases you navigate

Default behavior: each **checkpoint phase** (product spec, data model, architecture, test strategy, deploy) pauses for developer review before the next begins. After confirming, auto-chain skills run silently — then a combined review presents everything at once.

```bash
/sdlc:start "add loyalty points"              # interactive (default)
/sdlc:start "add loyalty points" --auto       # fully autonomous, no pauses
/sdlc:start "add loyalty points" --lightweight # skip data-model / arch phases
/sdlc:start --emergency "payment gateway down" # incident mode: plan → code → verify → deploy → retro
```

### Intent-driven routing — only the phases that matter

The orchestrator classifies your input into one of five intents, then runs only the phases that apply. No forcing yourself through research and synthesis when you're fixing a bug.

| Intent | Entry point | Phase path |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| `new-project` | Research | Full 20-phase lifecycle |
| `new-feature` | Product spec | idea → data-model → design → plan → code → test-cases → test-gen → verify → deploy |
| `bug-fix` | Plan | plan → code → test-cases → verify → deploy |
| `refactor` | Synthesize | synthesize → data-model check → plan → code → test-cases → verify |
| `documentation` | Product spec | idea only |

Supply the intent explicitly or let the orchestrator classify from your description:

```bash
/sdlc:start --intent bug-fix "order total wrong when discount applied"
/sdlc:start --intent new-feature "add multi-currency support"
```

### Auto-chain execution — compound phases without compound commands

After each checkpoint phase completes, related skills run automatically. You confirm the checkpoint; everything else happens behind it.

After **design**: threat modeling, ADR validation, and infrastructure design run in sequence.
After **code**: security scan, dependency audit, test gap analysis, and PII audit run in sequence.
After **deploy**: release notes and maintenance plan run in sequence.

All auto-chain results appear in a single combined review pause per checkpoint:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[DESIGN] complete. Artifact: artifacts/tech-arch/tech-architecture.md
Three-tier clean architecture with PostgreSQL datastore.

Auto-chained:
  ✅ threat-model — 2 HIGH findings (auth bypass, SQL injection) [artifacts/threat-model/]
  ✅ adr-gen — 4 ADRs validated, 1 missing rationale [artifacts/tech-arch/solution-design.md]
  ✅ infra-design — Dockerfile + Helm chart scaffolded [artifacts/infra-design/]

Quality gate for PLAN: PASS

→ "continue"    — proceed to plan
→ "new session" — save checkpoint here
→ "deep review" — run full traceability analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Branch-scoped workspaces

Every git branch has its own isolated workspace. State, progress, and artifacts are stored at `.claude/ai-sdlc/workflows/<branch>/` — sanitized from the branch name. Switching branches switches full context. History of previous runs is archived to `.claude/ai-sdlc/history/`.

```
.claude/ai-sdlc/
  workflows/
    feature--payments/       ← feature/payments branch
      state.json             ← phase status, decisions, gate overrides
      progress.json          ← task tracking
      artifacts/             ← all phase outputs
    main/                    ← main branch workspace
  history/                   ← archived past runs
  codebase/                  ← codebase map (shared across branches)
  CLAUDE.md                  ← framework reference
```

### Stale cascade — know exactly what needs revisiting

When you re-run a phase, the system automatically marks all downstream phases as stale. The artifact still exists and is readable — but the dashboard flags it, and the next phase's gate warns before proceeding.

```
✅ data-model   — completed 2026-03-25
⚠️ tech-arch    — stale (data-model re-run)
⚠️ plan         — stale (data-model re-run)
⏳ code         — pending
```

When you hit a stale phase: `"refresh"` (regenerate), `"continue as-is"` (accept staleness), or `"view"` (inspect before deciding).

### Requirements that actually drive the work
Every requirement gets a `REQ-ID`. Every business rule gets a `BR-ID`. Every NFR gets a **numeric threshold** — not "fast" but "p95 < 200ms at 1000 RPS". These IDs flow all the way through to test cases and automation. When a requirement changes, you know exactly what breaks.

### A data model that's the single source of truth
The canonical data model is designed before architecture and code. Everything derives from it — API shapes, domain entities, test factories, database migrations. Change a field in the data model and automatic impact analysis tells you exactly what breaks downstream before you touch a line of code.

### Operational processes mapped before the data model locks in

For projects with back-office operations, `/sdlc:business-process` maps every operational process between customer journeys and the data model — not after the fact, when changing the model is expensive.

Every process gets a **BP-ID** and is documented with: a Mermaid swimlane sequence diagram showing actor interactions and branching; a **RACI table** per step; **SLA breakdowns** with breach actions; and full **exception paths** (what fails, who is notified, how recovery works).

The key output is `## Data Model Implications Summary` — a consolidated table of every new entity, state machine field, and relationship the processes require. Phase 5 reads this table before modelling begins, so entities like `ApprovalRecord`, `EscalationLog`, and `JobExecution` are designed in rather than bolted on. Process-driven fields like `status`, `assigned_to`, and `sla_deadline` are first-class model citizens, not afterthoughts.

### Clean architecture that stays clean
Code is implemented in strict layer order: domain → application → infrastructure → delivery. The dependency rule (no infrastructure imports in domain or application layers) is enforced. Every external integration goes through a port interface. No God objects, no magic numbers, no spaghetti.

### Cross-platform screens generated from journey maps

When a project includes a front-end, one command turns the customer journey into a complete screen specification:

```bash
/sdlc:fe-setup         # after Phase 6 — configures tokens, derives screen spec
/sdlc:fe-screen LoginScreen   # during Phase 8 — generates the screen
```

**`/sdlc:fe-setup`** asks one question (design system level: none / brand color / full ingest), then:
- Builds a full design token set — 12-step color palette, semantic colors, typography scale, spacing, shadow, motion
- Configures the component library (Tamagui by default for cross-platform performance)
- Walks the customer journey and derives a screen inventory: every interactive step becomes a screen, each assigned a template type, API endpoints mapped, and all four states documented (loading → skeleton, empty, error + retry, success)

**`/sdlc:fe-screen`** generates a single screen from that spec:
- Reads the screen's data requirements and wires API calls as typed TanStack Query hooks
- Applies tokens via the component library — no hardcoded colors, no magic numbers
- Implements all four states and extracts any component that appears in 2+ screens to `components/ui/`
- Enforces WCAG 2.1 AA: 44×44pt touch targets, contrast ratios, screen reader labels, focus management

The stack is Expo + React Native + Expo Router v3 — one codebase for iOS, Android, and Web. Clean architecture applies to the FE layer too: business logic stays in hooks and services, screens are pure view layer.

The `[fe]` task tag in `implementation-plan.md` is the discriminator — Phase 8 detects it and switches to the FE workflow automatically.

### Tests anchored to requirements, not vibes
Test cases are derived from every source: requirements, API spec, data model invariants, architecture decisions, observability commitments. Nine test layers — unit, integration, contract, E2E, performance, scalability, resilience, observability, security, plus smoke/synthetic monitoring — all with TC-IDs that trace back to a source document. NFR-IDs trace forward through ADRs to TC-IDs to SLOs, closing the full traceability chain. No orphaned tests. No uncovered requirements. Coverage gates fail the CI build.

Test gen (Phase 10) is a separate checkpoint from test cases (Phase 9) — the developer confirms the test strategy before automation code is generated.

### Resilience built in, not bolted on
Every external dependency is classified (CRITICAL / DEGRADABLE / OPTIONAL) with explicit timeouts, circuit breakers, fallbacks, and retry logic. The system checks that your CRITICAL dependencies have circuit breakers, your DEGRADABLE dependencies have fallbacks, and every client has explicit connect and read timeouts. Chaos tests verify it all actually works.

### Observability as a first-class deliverable
Structured JSON logging with mandatory `trace_id` and `span_id` fields. OpenTelemetry distributed tracing with W3C context propagation. Prometheus RED metrics at every service boundary. Health endpoints (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health/startup`) that actually check dependencies. All committed to `observability.md` with `OBS-IDs` that test cases verify.

### Production-ready microservice scaffolding in one command
```bash
/sdlc:scaffold "payment-service"
```
Generates: clean architecture skeleton, multi-stage Dockerfile (non-root user, layer caching), docker-compose local dev stack, Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, HPA, PDB), Kustomize overlays for staging/production, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with Trivy CVE scanning, graceful shutdown handler, all three health probes.

### A planning construct built for agentic development

Story points measure coding effort. In agentic development, coding is largely automated — the scarce resource is **human judgment and attention**. AI-SDLC uses a different planning unit: the **Human Session**.

```bash
/sdlc:roadmap   # generates artifacts/roadmap/roadmap.md
```

Three session types map to where humans are actually needed:

| Type | Symbol | When |
|------|--------|------|
| **Design (D)** | ✍ | Human drives — product spec, data model, architecture, review. Judgment-heavy. |
| **Review (R)** | 👁 | AI ran, human validates — research output, test cases, plan. Async-friendly. |
| **Sync (S)** | 👥 | Microsquad alignment — phase handoffs, gate decisions. 30 min. |

Every phase gets an **AI autonomy level** — from 🤖 Autonomous (code, test automation: human not needed) to ✍ Collaborative (product spec, data model: human must drive). This tells a microsquad who needs to be present and when.

The roadmap surfaces the critical path clearly: **Product Spec → Data Model → Tech Architecture → Code**. The data model is the highest-risk gate — extra design sessions here pay for themselves many times over. The code phase is fully autonomous.

For a typical new service: **~16 Design Sessions + ~3 Review Sessions** of human effort. The rest is AI. Optional for individual developers — skip it and work phase by phase if you prefer.

### Decisions captured automatically — never lost to context

Every architectural and product decision made in conversation is silently recorded to `state.json` by the always-on `/sdlc:decide` skill. No command to run. No reminder needed. The moment you say "we'll use Postgres", "JWT not sessions", or "dropping bulk import from v1" — it's written down with the reason and a flag for any downstream documents that may now be stale.

### Documents structured for both human and AI reading

Every document produced by AI-SDLC follows a strict writing standard that serves two goals simultaneously: readable by a human in under 5 minutes, and answerable by Claude using the minimum possible tokens.

The **50-line rule**: every document's first 50 lines contain a TL;DR and a contents index — so Claude can orient and jump to the relevant section without loading the whole file. **Tables over prose**: structured data (requirements, fields, decisions, error codes) always in tables at ~40% fewer tokens. **IDs at line start**: every REQ-ID, BR-ID, TC-ID, ADR-ID begins its line so any reference is a single grep away. **Complexity budgets**: hard limits per document type that trigger sharding before a file becomes a monolith Claude loads in full every time.

The result: as your project grows to dozens of documents, token cost stays flat because Claude loads what it needs — not everything.

### An independent quality gate between every phase
```bash
/sdlc:verify              # auto-runs after every phase
/sdlc:verify --phase 5    # explicitly check phase 5
/sdlc:verify --all        # full audit across all phases
```
Verification goes beyond "does the file exist?" — it checks completeness (no placeholders, all required sections), internal consistency (every entity has timestamps and invariants), and cross-phase consistency (every NFR in the spec has an architectural decision that addresses it, every API endpoint has a contract test).

Eleven gates enforce specific structural requirements before each phase transition. The most critical: the DATA-MODEL gate blocks both tech-arch and test-cases — no exceptions.

### Brownfield codebase understanding without heavy tooling

AI-SDLC uses a persistent, version-controlled index that lives right in the repo:

```bash
/sdlc:map      # spawns 4 parallel read-only agents → writes codebase/ documents
/sdlc:gaps     # spawns 3 gap analysis agents: tech debt, arch drift, quality coverage
```

Four specialised read-only agents run in parallel: architecture mapper (layer structure, components, data flow), tech stack mapper (dependencies, toolchain), conventions mapper (naming, file organisation, patterns), and cross-cutting concerns mapper (auth, logging, error handling, caching).

```bash
/sdlc:explore "where is payment processing handled?"
/sdlc:explore "what calls OrderService?"
/sdlc:explore "if I change the user_id field, what breaks?"
/sdlc:explore "show me all API endpoints"
```

The map is consumed automatically by `/sdlc:synthesize` (no re-scanning the whole codebase) and by the orchestrator on startup (context-aware routing from the first command). When `/sdlc:explore` discovers something the map missed, it updates the map — so it gets better over time.

### Iterative development — keep adding features without starting over

The initial lifecycle gets you to a production-ready v1. Everything after that flows through the **iteration model**:

```bash
/sdlc:iterate "add multi-currency support"
/sdlc:iterate "loyalty points module"
/sdlc:iterate --type enhancement "improve checkout performance"
/sdlc:iterate --voc  # customer feedback triggered a spec change
```

Each iteration is a **scoped mini-lifecycle**. Instead of re-running all phases, `/sdlc:iterate` determines which phases are actually affected by the change and executes only those — in the correct order, with impact propagation between them.

Every iteration gets a stable ID (`ITER-001`, `ITER-002`, ...) and a scope manifest that tracks:
- Which phases are in scope and their status
- Which sections of each document were changed
- Every new ID introduced (REQ, BR, TC, ADR, NFR) — continuing the existing sequence, never restarting
- Breaking changes (require explicit confirmation before proceeding)
- Propagation flags (e.g. "new NFR added → Phase 6 needs ADR, Phase 11 needs SLO")

**Iteration types** cover every kind of change:

| Type | Command | Phases touched |
|------|---------|---------------|
| New feature/module | `/sdlc:iterate "feature name"` | 3 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 |
| Extend existing feature | `/sdlc:iterate --type enhancement "..."` | 3 → 5? → 6? → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 |
| New NFR/SLA target | `/sdlc:iterate --type nfr "..."` | 3 → 6 → 9 → 11 → 12 |
| Schema-only change | `/sdlc:iterate --type data "..."` | 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 |
| UX/journey update | `/sdlc:iterate --type ux "..."` | 4 → 6b? → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 |
| Customer feedback gap | `/sdlc:iterate --voc` | 1b → 3 → then per impact |

**Upstream documents stay continuously fresh** — VOC, research, and personas can be updated standalone at any time. When they surface a product gap, they recommend an iteration. When they confirm existing requirements, no iteration is needed.

The orchestrator (`/sdlc:start`) is iteration-aware: it surfaces any active in-progress iteration at startup and recommends `/sdlc:iterate` rather than re-running phases when an established project is detected.

### Context management that actually works across sessions
One of the hardest problems with AI-assisted development is losing context — mid-session when Claude auto-compacts, or the next morning when you start fresh. AI-SDLC solves this with a structured daily loop:

**End of day — `/sdlc:eod`**
Reaches a clean stopping point, commits work in progress with a descriptive message, saves a precise snapshot of where you are (phase, step, open decisions, anything said verbally that isn't in the docs), and tells you exactly what to run first tomorrow.

**During the day — `/loop 15m /sdlc:checkpoint`**
Auto-saves your session state every 15 minutes. If context fills and Claude auto-compacts, nothing is lost. `/clear` followed by `/sdlc:restore` restores full context in under a minute.

**Start of day — `/sdlc:sod`**
Reads yesterday's checkpoint, flags any stale decisions or unverified phases, sets a realistic goal for the day, and delivers a structured brief — before executing a single thing. One "go" and you're working again.

```
Morning:  /sdlc:sod
During:   /loop 15m /sdlc:checkpoint
Evening:  /sdlc:eod
```

No more "where was I?". No more re-explaining context to a fresh Claude. No more lost decisions. The project state lives in files — and the daily ritual keeps those files exactly current.

## Installation

AI-SDLC is a Claude Code plugin — a directory of Markdown instruction files that Claude reads and executes. No npm package, no runtime binary, no install script.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/seanieb9/ai-sdlc.git

# Install as a Claude Code plugin in your project
cp -r ai-sdlc/ <your-project>/.claude/plugins/ai-sdlc/
```

Open your project in Claude Code and run `/sdlc:start "your idea"` to start a new project, or `/sdlc:start` (no args) to see the status of an existing one.

On first run, the plugin automatically:
1. Detects your git branch and creates a branch-scoped workspace
2. Creates `.claude/ai-sdlc/CLAUDE.md` (framework reference)
3. Asks 5 setup questions → generates `.claude/ai-sdlc.config.yaml`
4. Offers to add `.gitignore` entries

### Configure

Edit `.claude/ai-sdlc.config.yaml`. Critical fields:

```yaml
version: 2.0.0
projectName: "my-service"      # required
techStack:
  language: typescript         # required
  framework: nestjs
  database: postgresql
  testFramework: jest
  containerRuntime: Docker      # drives deployment checklist
  orchestrator: Kubernetes
quality:
  coverage:
    overall: 80
    businessLogic: 90
```

### What to commit vs exclude

```gitignore
# Per-developer runtime state — do NOT commit
.claude/ai-sdlc/workflows/*/state.json
.claude/ai-sdlc/workflows/*/progress.json
.claude/ai-sdlc/history/

# Commit these (team-shared artifacts)
# .claude/ai-sdlc/CLAUDE.md
# .claude/ai-sdlc.config.yaml
# .claude/ai-sdlc/workflows/*/artifacts/
# .claude/ai-sdlc/codebase/
```

## Commands

These are the commands you need to know. Everything else runs internally.

### The main interface

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sdlc:start [idea]` | **Universal entry point.** New project, status check, daily brief, resume — handles everything. Also accepts natural language: `morning`, `done`, `save`, `roadmap`, `verify`, `help`. |
| `/sdlc:iterate <feature>` | **Add or evolve features.** Scoped mini-lifecycle — updates only the docs and phases the change actually touches. |
| `/sdlc:fix <what's broken>` | **Fix things.** Bug fixes (default), hotfixes (`--hotfix` for production incidents), maintenance (`--maintenance` for debt/upgrades). Lighter path — no spec update unless a design gap is discovered. |
| `/sdlc:release [version]` | **Ship work.** Groups completed ITER-NNN + FIX-NNN into a versioned release. Generates CHANGELOG.md entry, release summary, git tag recommendation. |
| `/sdlc:review [area]` | **Quality audit.** 12-dimension cross-cutting review: requirements, data, arch, tests, resilience, deployment, security. |

### Codebase navigation

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sdlc:explore <question>` | Answer codebase questions: "where is X?", "what calls Y?", "how are errors handled?". **Auto-triggers** on location/caller/convention questions. |
| `/sdlc:map` | Brownfield setup — 4 parallel read-only agents map architecture, tech stack, conventions, and cross-cutting concerns into `.claude/ai-sdlc/codebase/`. Run once on an existing project before anything else. |
| `/sdlc:gaps` | 3 gap analysis agents — tech debt prioritization, architecture drift, quality/coverage gaps. Run after `/sdlc:map`. |

## What Gets Produced

Every phase outputs to a canonical artifact in the branch-scoped workspace. Artifacts are **updated in place** — never versioned with `_v2` suffixes, never duplicated.

Every artifact starts with a header on line 1:

## Key Design Principles

**Data model first.** Architecture, API shapes, and code all derive from the canonical data model — not the other way around. Any change to an existing entity triggers automatic impact analysis showing exactly what breaks downstream.

**No code without a plan.** Tasks are atomic, layered (domain → application → infrastructure → delivery), and independently verifiable. The clean architecture dependency rule is enforced — domain code has zero infrastructure dependencies.

**Phase scope boundaries are explicit.** Phase 8 implements business logic and application-layer error handling — nothing more. Resilience patterns (circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts, graceful degradation) are Phase 12 work. Observability spec is Phase 11 work. This keeps each phase focused and prevents developers from guessing what belongs where.

**Tests from requirements, not from code.** Test cases are derived from every source document: requirements, API spec, data model invariants, architecture decisions, observability contracts. Nine test layers ensure nothing is missed. Every TC-ID traces to a source.

**Verify before you proceed.** Each phase has an independent verification step that checks completeness, internal consistency, and cross-phase references. The orchestrator warns if you skip it.

**Documents are living artifacts.** When requirements change, update `prd.md`. When the data model evolves, update `data-model.md` with a change history entry. IDs (REQ, BR, TC) are permanent — only deprecated, never deleted.

**Token cost is a design constraint.** Documents are structured to be partially loadable — first 50 lines orient, sections answer one question each, shards are independently readable. Claude loads what it needs, not everything. This keeps context cost flat as the project grows.
